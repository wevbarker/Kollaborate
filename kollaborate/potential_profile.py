'''
Dear Colleague, this file has been generated automatically by my Maple program. It contains an expression in the python syntax.
Description of quantity: This is a function in r (perhaps better called x, since it can be negative), and z, which encodes the gravitational potential. The arguments are again given in kpc, but the overall units are not quite clear to me at first glance. No reference seems to be made to any file name.

def provided_function(r,z):
	return -10/(r**2+(.373+(z**2+.9e-1)**(1/2))**2)**(1/2)
