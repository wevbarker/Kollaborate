Dear Colleague, this file has been generated automatically by my Maple program. It contains an expression in the python syntax.
Description of quantity: Analytic approximation, this is a function of r. Corrected psi function again, i.e. radial coordinate multiplied by negative of poloidal magnetic flux. Same conerns apply. This is to be plotted with the numerical counterpart again, for comparison. No reference seems to be made to any file name.
