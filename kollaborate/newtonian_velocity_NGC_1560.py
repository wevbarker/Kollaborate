Dear Colleague, this file has been generated automatically by my Maple program. It contains an expression in the python syntax.
Description of quantity: Newtonian approximation without rotation, this is a function (in units of c?), of r in kpc, to be plotted from 0 to 8.29 along with the exact MN integral from earlier. This seems otherwise free from ambiguities. No reference seems to be made to any file name.
